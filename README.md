### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### 'List.js'

Contains the home page which renders the Appbar and the list of movies fetched from the api and retrived from the redux store.

### 'Details.js'

Contains the detailed information about a single movie which user has clicked to view it.

### 'Challenges'

Settings Redux store and storing all movies data in the store(long setup for a small app)
Coded in Material UI which gives users good experience interms of responsiveness and the UX design.
Used styling using makeStyles from Material UI makes work easier and embeded into a single file.
Backdrop along with the cicrular loader is used when api call has been made(as an extra thing).

### 'IF more time'

Would have done with propTypes checking for all the components (To make app more type check)
Seperated the fetch calls in seperate folder and access them in secure Abstraction way. (To hide api call directly viewing in the components file)
